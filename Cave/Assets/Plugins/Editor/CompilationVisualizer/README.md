# Compilation Visualizer for Unity

## Quick Start
Install via OpenUPM: https://openupm.com/packages/com.needle.compilation-visualizer/

You can open the **Compilation Visualizer** by selecting `Window > Analysis > Compilation Timeline`.

It shows a timeline of assembly compilation. This is especially helpful when trying to optimize compile times and dependencies between assemblies.
Besides showing a graphical view of compilation, selecting an assembly shows both dependencies and dependents of that assembly.
